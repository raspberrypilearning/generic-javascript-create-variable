A variable allows you to store data within a program. Variables have a name and a value.

This variable has the name `animal` and the value `"cat"`:

```javascript
var animal = "cat";
```

This variable has the name `score` and the value `30`:

```javascript
var score = 30;
```

To create a variable, give it a name and set it equal to a value. The name of the variable always goes after `var`, and it must not contain any spaces.
